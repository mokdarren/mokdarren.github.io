      <description>Greetings fellow traders,
We achieved a 100% win rate with three winning trades, and we&amp;rsquo;re up 4.5% in just three days. This Flush Algo took me close to 1 month to backtest and develop and I&amp;rsquo;m glad it&amp;rsquo;s showing good potential! I will be updating the Algo&amp;rsquo;s performance in this google spreadsheet: https://bit.ly/2ZBIAQv
It&amp;rsquo;s looking pretty good being up 4.5%, but it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell it&amp;rsquo;s long-term performance with a sample size of 3 trades.</description>

      <description>This entry will mark the start of running a live algorithm on OANDA, I will document it&#39;s performance weekly on this blog to determine it&#39;s profitability. I call this strategy the Flush strategy, and it makes trades when a significant move is felt in the market. After performing backtests on 2 years of past data, I found this strategy to be highly profitable on volatile markets such as Crude Oil and Gold.</description>

      <description>COVID19 has not only shortened my dreamy 6-month long study abroad program in Sweden but also caused my internship at a reputable bank to be canceled. As Parkinson&#39;s Second Law puts it, &#34;work expands to fill the time available for its completion&#34;. I had to do something about it to make my time productive. I never had the opportunity to explore Web technologies outside of my Academic Work in NUS. Therefore this was a good opportunity to explore the field of Web Development.</description>
